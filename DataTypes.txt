bool (short for boolean): this can have a true or a false value.

byte: represents an integer between 0 and 255.

sbyte (signed byte): represents an integer between -128 and 127.

char (short for character): represents one Unicode character.

decimal: represents any number up to 28 or 29 digits in length.

double: represents any number up to 15 or 16 digits in length.

float: represents any number up to 7 digits in length.

	Float (32-bits),

	Double (64-bits), and

	Decimal (128-bits).

int: represents a whole number between roughly -2,000,000,000 and 2,000,000,000.

uint (unsigned integer): represents a whole number between 0 and about 4,000,000,000.


long: represents a whole number between roughly negative 9 quintillion (-9,000,000,000,000,000,000) and positive 9 quintillion (9,000,000,000,000,000,000).

	The long data type is the 64-bit version of int (which is 32-bits).


ulong (unsigned long): represents a whole number between 0 and 18 quintillion (18,000,000,000,000,000,000).

	The ulong data type is the 64-bit version of uint (which is 32-bits).


short: represents a whole number between -32,678 and 32,767.

	The short data type is the 16-bit version of int.


ushort (unsigned short): represents a whole number between 0 and 65,535.

string: represents a set of 0 or more Unicode characters. Strings are delimited by double-quotation marks.
	
	
Remember, a variable is simply a named location in memory. Itâ€™s helpful for proper memory allocation to 		assign proper data types.


String to Integer:
	Convert.ToInt32();

Integer to String:
	currentAge.ToString();

Bool to String:
	Convert.ToString();
